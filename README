Way of the stick is a minimalistic fighting game.  Movement and hand to hand attacks are the only tools at your disposal.  Attacks follow rock-paper-scissors like style of precedence:
    Quick Attacks beat Strong Attacks
    Tricky Attacks beat Quick Attacks
    Strong Attacks beat Tricky Attacks

At the moment only a moveset editor and a basic versus mode are currently in place.

Playing the Game

Press any button to get past the splash screen to the main menu.  On the main menu there are four buttons:

 - Versus Mode
 - Moveset Builder
 - Controls
 - Settings

To play a game select versus mode.  You will go to the character select screen and be presented with several choices.

The first is to select which player is human and which is a bot.

The next choice is to select a moveset for each player.  Click the arrows to switch between movesets.

The last choice is optional.  You can change the characteristics of your player for speed or power based on size slider.

When you've made your choices the button to start the match will be active and you can play a game.


Exporting and Importing Movesets

Way of the Stick creates a sharing folder in your home folder (user folder on windows) for sharing called "wots_sharing".  When you export a moveset will be in the "wots_sharing/exported" folder.  To import a moveset move the .mvs file into "wots_sharing/new" folder.  Movesets that have been imported will move to the "wots_sharing/imported" folder.

Using the Movset Editor (TODO)
