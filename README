Playing the Game

Press any button to get past the splash screen to the main menu.  On the main menu there are four buttons:

 - Versus Mode
 - Moveset Builder
 - Controls
 - Settings

To play a game select versus mode.  You will go to the character select screen and be presented with several choices.

The first is to select which player is human and which is a bot.  The game doesn't support two human players, so if both are human both players will move according to one set of controls.

The next choice is to select a moveset for each player.  Use the arrows to switch between selected movesets.

The last choice is optional.  You can change the characteristics of your player for speed or power based on Size slider.

When you've made your choices The button to start the match will be active and you can play a game.
